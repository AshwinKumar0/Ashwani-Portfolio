        <h1>Homestay Operations Reset</h1>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Operations manager and systems designer</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Seasonal pressure created variability in service consistency, communication, and cost control.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Team response depended on individuals, not process, leading to fragile execution under stress.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Introduced SOPs, incident paths, inventory checkpoints, and weekly review loops.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Stabilized service delivery and made operational performance easier to measure.</p>
        <p><strong>Lessons:</strong> Calm systems are built before crisis, not during it.</p>
