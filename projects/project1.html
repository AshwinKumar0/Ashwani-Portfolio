        <h1>Operational Dashboard Prototype</h1>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Product thinker and front-end builder</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Homestay operations required daily clarity over occupancy, supplies, and issue escalation.</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Decisions were reactive because the same information lived across calls, notebooks, and memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Designed a single-screen JavaScript prototype with grouped metrics, alert thresholds, and weekly trend views.</p>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Reduced decision lag and introduced repeatable weekly planning routines.</p>
        <p><strong>Lessons:</strong> A simple interface can outperform a complex one when it mirrors real operational decisions.</p>
